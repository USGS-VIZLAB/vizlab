\details{
I've been thinking maybe switching 'x' to 'viz' would be more clear

Sections are published individually but are returned invisibly
as text to be used directly.

This copies static resources to the target directory, and invisibly
will return the preferred usage.

The job of minification or css precompiling could also be added here, but
currently this is not handled.

Also, templating the resources that make sense would be useful
